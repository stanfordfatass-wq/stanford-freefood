Done. Give it a few minutes, then your feed is at:

    https://${OWNER}.github.io/${REPO}/feed.ics

Subscribe on iPhone:
    Settings > Calendar > Accounts > Add Account > Other
    > Add Subscribed Calendar  ->  paste that URL

Leave "Remove Alarms" OFF -- the 45-minute alarm on each event is
the part that actually gets you to the food.

Then set Settings > Calendar > Accounts > Fetch New Data
     > Every 15 Minutes.

Watch the run:   gh run watch
See what it found: gh run view --log | grep "scraped"
